## LAB for Class04

**The Goal**
Given a data set containing characteristics about the Boston housing market, explore methods for predicting housing prices.

You'll need to clone this repository using RStudio first. 
Practice writing and adding code that produces a simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.
Include a visual and quantitative method for assessing whether some models may better explain housing prices than other models.

We will discuss some models students have proposed and ways to communicate these models to a lay audience.

### Data
The dataset and the data dictionary are included in the folder called data.

### Questions

* How would you explain SSE?
* How would you explain your model?
* Can you explain polynomial regression to an audience w/o using the term polynomial or regression?
